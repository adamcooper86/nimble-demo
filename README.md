Demo app for Nimble 

## A few Notes:

1. Thanks for the opportunity to submit this for your review. I appreciate your time, and the thoughtfulness put into the task. It seemed like a very appropriate task and I really appreciated the mockup to get started.

2. There are a lot of things that I didn't do that I normally would have for the sake of time. These include unit testing, separating components into distinct files with their accompanying css, using a build process to better bundle the final assets, importing the data as a data store, etc.

3. I intentionally left of the headers for the cards. It felt like the design was mixing a more Material Design card centered layout, and a more traditional table layout. I moved towards a more Material design card layout because I felt it would be more responsive (I checked the app on Iphone 6, tablet, small and wide computer screens).

4. Animations: I wish I had the time to add good animations for the cards, overlay, overlay transitions, etc. However, transitions are hard to do well, and take a good bit of time (at least they still do for me). I think they are worth it, but not in 3 hours.
